# BD Admission

A Bangladesh-focused, offline-first Android admission-preparation app for university (Varsity) and Medical admission questions. The app supports Bangla and English, question browsing, Flash Question practice, Standard Exam sessions, bookmarks, a local profile, and practice history. Engineering is visible as Coming Soon.

## Current implementation status

The core app implementation is wired across the Expo Router screens, SQLite database lifecycle, repositories, practice services, question-pack importer, and local user data. Automated checks pass as recorded in docs/QA_CHECKLIST.md.

This is **not yet a release sign-off**. Two DU A Unit packs are now bundled from the supplied scanned question-bank PDFs: 90 questions per session for 2024–2025 and 2025–2026, across six subject sections. The supplied answer-key letters are preserved; three questions without a printed key remain unanswered/unknown rather than guessed. The supplied publisher scan is a question-bank source, not an official DU past-paper notice. The official DU 2025–2026 notice describes 60 marks of MCQ plus 40 marks of written questions, with 45 minutes for each part ([official notice](https://www.du.ac.bd/du_post_details/news/25400)); its complete format differs from the scan’s four-of-six-subject MCQ-only practice pattern. That rule therefore remains **illustrative** and the app labels the selected-paper mode as question-bank practice, not a full official DU exam. Some diagram-based options are represented by text labels because the runtime does not yet render question figures as local assets. Two items are content-unverified and excluded from scored practice: one figure-only physics item and one mathematics formula whose scanned expression is unclear.

The app has not yet been validated on a physical Android device or emulator, and a normal Hermes bytecode export crashes on this ARM/NetHunter host. The successful no-bytecode export is a JavaScript bundle check, not an APK/AAB build.

## Main features

- **Offline-first data:** SQLite is the local source of truth for question content, paper/source references, exam attempts, answers, bookmarks, profile preferences and activity history.
- **Varsity and Medical catalogues:** institution/paper selection is driven by imported data; the question browser paginates results and supports bookmarks.
- **Flash Question:** one question at a time, 30-second default with configurable duration, deadline-based timing, no repeats until a pool cycle is exhausted, skip/exit, answer feedback, summaries and persistent history.
- **Standard Exam:** uses the selected paper’s configured question count, duration and subject-selection rule when available; the general all-catalogue mode defaults to 100 questions/60 minutes. For the imported DU A Unit packs, select exactly four of the six subjects, with 15 questions per selected section (60 questions, 45 minutes). Subjects with a missing source answer key are unavailable for scored section selection. The publisher-scan pattern is explicitly marked illustrative because it differs from the official DU 2025–2026 notice, which also includes a written section; do not present this question-bank practice mode as a full official university exam. The question grid, answer revision/clearing, submission confirmation, timeout auto-submit, results and review are shared across patterns.
- **Scoring integrity:** answer keys and marking rules carry verification status. The app does not present illustrative/unconfigured rules as official and does not score questions without a verified correct answer.
- **Local profile and activity:** Bangla/English preference, preferred Flash duration, progress summary, bookmarks and history persist locally.
- **Engineering:** intentionally presented as Coming Soon.

## Technology

- Expo SDK version ~57.0.31, React Native 0.86.3, TypeScript and Expo Router.
- Expo SQLite with versioned migrations and a serialized SqlDb adapter.
- NativeWind and local shared UI components/theme.
- Bangla and English translations; Bangla is the default language.
- Node's built-in test runner, with SQLite behavior tested via node:sqlite behind the shared database contract.

The project is independent of the original ScholarHub checkout. Reused UI/configuration foundations are copied/adapted into this repository; the app does not require ScholarHub at runtime or build time.

## Setup and development

Use the project's Node version (Node 22.23.1) before running commands:

    source "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"
    nvm use 22.23.1
    pnpm install

Start Expo:

    pnpm start

Run the native Android development flow on a machine with the required Android toolchain and a connected device/emulator:

    pnpm android

## Verification commands

Run the focused automated checks from the project root:

    pnpm test
    pnpm typecheck
    pnpm lint
    pnpm exec expo config --type public
    pnpm doctor

Validate the JavaScript bundle without Hermes bytecode generation:

    pnpm exec expo export --platform android --no-bytecode

The checks last verified for the application pass are recorded in docs/QA_CHECKLIST.md. The standard pnpm export:android command currently fails when hermesc raises SIGILL on this ARM/NetHunter host. The no-bytecode export succeeds and validates Metro bundling, but it does not generate or verify an installable Android release artifact. Release build and physical-device checks remain outstanding.

## Question data and import

The initial genuine-content packs are:

- `data/question-packs/du-a-2024-2025.json` — 90 DU A Unit questions.
- `data/question-packs/du-a-2025-2026.json` — 90 DU A Unit questions.

Each pack stores the source PDF name/SHA-256, session, six subject sections, source page/question numbers and answer-key verification state. Three questions have no printed correct-answer letter and are intentionally excluded from scored practice. The original PDF scans remain outside the app repository at `/home/kali/gpt-workspace/bd-admission-app-data/`; they are not included in the mobile bundle.

Read:

- docs/QUESTION_DATA_SCHEMA.md for the version-1 pack contract.
- docs/QUESTION_IMPORT_WORKFLOW.md for extraction, verification, validation and import steps.

For a new/updated version-1 JSON pack, validate and regenerate the bundle index:

    pnpm packs:validate data/question-packs/your-pack-file.json
    pnpm packs:index

After rebuilding, startup sync imports changed bundled packs transactionally. Re-imports are idempotent and preserve attempts/bookmarks. Keep answer and marking-rule verification explicit, and keep the original source/page/question-number references.

## Product principles

- Core catalog, practice, scoring, history and preferences must work offline.
- Preserve institution, paper/year/unit, source document, page and question-number provenance when supplied.
- Never assume question count, duration, subject distribution or scoring is the same across universities; verify the exact exam pattern from an official source and configure the matching paper/session. Do not fabricate, pad or truncate questions to meet a global count.
- Unknown answers and unverified marking rules must stay unknown.
- Validate and import content transactionally without damaging attempts or bookmarks.
- Do not automatically merge questions based only on similar wording.
- Keep synthetic test fixtures separate from genuine historical question packs.
