# Project context

## Product
BD Admission is a Bangladesh-focused preparation app for university and Medical admission questions. Students will practice historical multiple-choice questions with the institution, year, unit/paper and source reference retained. Engineering is visible in the initial product as Coming Soon; Engineering question content is a later batch.

## Primary users
Bangladeshi admission candidates using Android phones, potentially with unreliable or unavailable internet. Bangla is the default interface language; English is supported.

## Core modes
- Flash Question: one question at a time; 30-second default with configurable time; continuously cycles through the eligible pool without repeats until a cycle is exhausted; skip and exit; local performance summary.
- Standard Exam: exactly 100 eligible questions, a 60-minute default, navigation across the full paper, editable answers before submission, automatic time-expiry submission and configurable negative marking.
- Result review: local answers, correct/incorrect/unanswered counts, accuracy and scoring provenance.

## Product boundaries
The initial release is single-device and local-first. A sign-in service, hosted backend and cloud sync are not prerequisites. Historical question data will be supplied in PDF batches after the application foundation is built. Do not invent or prefill factual historical content. Synthetic fixtures belong only in development/test locations and must be labelled.

## Success criteria
Fast, readable, offline question practice; accurate source/year metadata; reliable local persistence; deterministic timer/scoring; repeatable and safe question imports; UI components reused from the author's ScholarHub app where appropriate.
